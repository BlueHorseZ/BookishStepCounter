Hi!
Bookish Step Counter is my hobby project to learn android app development.
The idea behind the project is to encourage my fellow book lovers to get up and Take a Step to their favourite Book Worlds.
Every challenge is inspired by one of a YA/NA fantasy book.

Work is still in progress - at the moment the challenge that works just fine is the Ley Lines one.

Next:
- completing other challenges
- add database to store the accomplishments

I create most of the background images in Canva
